//! An audio sample rate conversion library for Rust.
//!
//! This library provides resamplers to process audio in chunks.
//!
//! The ratio between input and output sample rates is completely free.
//! Implementations are available that accept a fixed length input
//! while returning a variable length output, and vice versa.
//!
//! ## Asynchronous resampling
//! The resampling is based on band-limited interpolation using sinc
//! interpolation filters. The sinc interpolation upsamples by an adjustable factor,
//! and then the new sample points are calculated by interpolating between these points.
//! The resampling ratio can be updated at any time.
//!
//! ## Synchronous resampling
//! Synchronous resampling is implemented via FFT. The data is FFT:ed, the spectrum modified,
//! and then inverse FFT:ed to get the resampled data.
//! This type of resampler is considerably faster but doesn't support changing the resampling ratio.
//!
//! ## SIMD acceleration
//! The asynchronous resampler is designed to benefit from auto-vectorization, meaning that the Rust compiler
//! can recognize calculations that can be done in parallel. It will then use SIMD instructions for those.
//! This works quite well, but there is still room for improvement.
//! On x86_64 it will always use SSE3 if available. The speed benefit compared to auto-vectorization
//! depends on the CPU, but tends to be in the range 20-30% for 64-bit data, and 50-100% for 32-bit data.
//!
//! ## Cargo features
//! #### `avx`: AVX on x86_64
//! The `avx` feature is enabled by default, and enables the use of AVX when it's available.
//! The speed increase compared to SSE depends on the CPU, and tends to range from zero to 50%.
//! On other architectures than x86_64 the `avx` feature does nothing.
//!
//! #### `neon`: Experimental Neon support on aarch64
//! Experimental support for Neon is available for aarch64 (64-bit Arm) by enabling the `neon` feature.
//! This requires the use of a nightly compiler, as the Neon support in Rust is still experimental.
//! On a Raspberry Pi 4, this gives a boost of about 10% for 64-bit floats and 50% for 32-bit floats when
//! compared to the auto-vectorized implementation.
//! Note that this only works on a full 64-bit operating system.
//!
//! ## Documentation
//!
//! The full documentation can be generated by rustdoc. To generate and view it run:
//! ```text
//! cargo doc --open
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example
//! Resample a single chunk of a dummy audio file from 44100 to 48000 Hz.
//! See also the "fixedin64" example that can be used to process a file from disk.
//! ```
//! use rubato::{Resampler, SincFixedIn, InterpolationType, InterpolationParameters, WindowFunction};
//! let params = InterpolationParameters {
//!     sinc_len: 256,
//!     f_cutoff: 0.95,
//!     interpolation: InterpolationType::Linear,
//!     oversampling_factor: 256,
//!     window: WindowFunction::BlackmanHarris2,
//! };
//! let mut resampler = SincFixedIn::<f64>::new(
//!     48000 as f64 / 44100 as f64,
//!     params,
//!     1024,
//!     2,
//! );
//!
//! let waves_in = vec![vec![0.0f64; 1024];2];
//! let waves_out = resampler.process(&waves_in).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//!
//! The `rubato` crate requires rustc version 1.40 or newer.
